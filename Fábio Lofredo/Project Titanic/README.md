# Titanic Project

The data was taken from kaggle on Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic

The analysis was done in 5 parts

1. Statistical Tests.
A statistical analysis of the data was made by obtaining the p-value and his conclusions, calculating values for obtain information and answering some questions.

2. Cleaning for Machine Learning.
the data were cleaned, and transformed into numbers, the data was exported for the step number 3.

3. Machine Learning, Regression for Age.
The following Machine Learning were used to calculate the age, the best algorithm exported the data:
Random Forest Regression (best results)
Decision Tree Regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Multiple Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression

4. Machine Learning, Classification for Survived (Prediction).
The following Machine Learning were used to calculate the survived, the best algorithm exported the data:
Logistic Regression (probabilistic approach) (best results)
Extreme Tree Classification
Decision Tree Classification
Random Forest Classification
KNN

5. Machine Learning, Unsupervised.
K-means was used to make analysis.
